As a developer I am tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 


Weather dashboard with form inputs:
Search for a city is called -
Return is current conditions and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. Will return will have the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index are also returned.

View the UV index -
Presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

Click on a city in the search history- 
Presented with current and future conditions for that city

Upon opening the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast



This app uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)for the current and forecast weather data collection.
